# BLOCKCHAIN-INTEGRATED COLLECTIBLES SYSTEM

This system was developed as part of the practical project for the final thesis - BLOCKCHAIN-INTEGRATED COLLECTIBLES SYSTEM, by Dyego Lourenço Pimentel, a graduate student in Fullstack Development at PUC-RS.

This system is a WEB 3 platform for buying and selling NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and utilizes resources such as Metamask and Firebase to create an anonymized login system.

## 🔴 Important Information
- The system was developed using Angular version 18;
- Typescript is the main programming language used in this project;
- It is necessary to have Metamask installed and properly configured to access certain features in the system, such as favoriting collection items;
- At the root of the project, there is a folder called `.github/workflows`, which contains the script used for automatic deployment (CI/CD) of the application;
- Firebase is an important part of the development; it was used as a backend as a service for hosting and anonymous user authentication.
- Firestore was chosen as the database due to its NoSQL nature and ease of integration.

## 🥷 Anonymized Login
This is a brief explanation of the login structure used in this project. Typically, a login consists of a username and password, but this is often unnecessary and invasive. Sometimes, simple registrations require CPF, addresses, etc.

Taking advantage of one of the characteristics created by Blockchain, I used the public key of the cryptocurrency wallet (in our case, Metamask) as the user's identifier, considering that the public key is a unique hash. Thus, when the user connects their Metamask to the system, the public key is stored as a document in the user collection in Firestore, and this document initially has only one attribute, which is the user's favorites array. As shown in the image below:

This way, we maintain data integrity and uniqueness without invading the user's privacy.

Below is everything you need to run this project locally.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites
 [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.3

 [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org) version 20.14.0

 [NVM](https://nodejs.org/download/package-manager) - NodeJs version manager

 [Metamask](https://metamask.io) - Cryptocurrency Wallet 

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - Responsible for hosting, authentication, and NoSQL database (Firestore)

## 🧑‍💻 Installing the Frontend

After installing all the tools mentioned above, clone this repository and access the root folder of the project "zuckerverso".

Install the dependencies listed in the package.json file by running the following command in the project's root:

```
npm install
```

Once all dependencies have been successfully installed, start the local server to launch the Frontend application by running the command below:
```
ng serve
```

If you've made it this far, you will be able to access the URL `http://localhost:4200/`. 

## 🌎 Build

If you eventually want to build this project to deploy it on a server, just run the command below in the project's root:
```
ng build
```
This command transforms the files generated by Angular into static files that will be available in the `dist/zuckerverso` folder.

## 🙏 Final Considerations
This project was very challenging and exciting, as Web3 and Blockchain are relatively new topics. Thank you very much for making it this far, and don't forget to star ⭐️ this repository if you are interested in seeing more content like this.
